# Park Mapper

[Viking Code School](https://vikingcodeschool.com) hackathon app created by [khopsickle](https://github.com/khopsickle/park_mapper) for finding parks in the San Francisco area.

## Usage

Check out the [live site](http://park-mapper.herokuapp.com/) and create an account to save your favorite parks.

Or visit the [Park index](http://park-mapper.herokuapp.com/parks) to search without creating an account.

Enter a zip code to start searching, sort and filter results based on park grades or acreage or leave the search box blank to get a full list.

## Credits

Park Mapper uses [San Francisco Open Data](https://data.sfgov.org), [Soda-Ruby](https://github.com/socrata/soda-ruby), and [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/).
